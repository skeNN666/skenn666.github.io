                            <p>Everyone has a lot of friends. Some are just acquaintances, while others are people you talk to every day and enjoy spending time with. These are called best friends and close friends. I’d like to introduce you to my close friends. I have seven close friends: Bilguun, Angarag, Tsogoo, Enkushe, Isee, Ilee, and Tengis. We were classmates in school. We often play CS2 together, and sometimes we play basketball. Out of all of them, I spend the most time with Bilguun. We play CS2 almost every day, and I enjoy arguing and talking about the NBA with him. He hates my favorite player, Damian Lillard, and whenever Lillard has a bad game, he messages me about it as if he’s been waiting for it to happen. Unfortunately for him, that only happens once every 30 games or so. Everyone has a bad game, right? Even Lebron has an off night sometimes.</p>
