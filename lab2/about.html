                            <p>Hi, My name is Altaibazar Gerelt-Od. I'm 20 years old. I was born and raised in Mongolia. I went to school â„–20. Now I'm a sophomore at the National University of Mongolia studying Information Systems. I envision my future as an individual with great skills in Data Science. I have a goal to be part of my favorite NBA team's success. At first, I dreamt about getting into the NBA and playing for the Portland Trail Blazers to help them win a championship. But sadly, I'm only 5'9". So, I thought about how I can still bring a championship to the city of Portland, and I decided to become a Data Scientist. Hope it happens. Ganbatte!</p>
